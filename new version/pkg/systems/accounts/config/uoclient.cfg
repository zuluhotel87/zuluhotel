#
# Explanation:
# The Protocol and Listener sections are optional.
# Each Listener section allows you to listen for different client encryption types on different ports.
# This means you can listen for "1.26.4" clients on port 5003 and "ignition" clients on port 5555.
# Valid encryption types are found in the pol.cfg section. If you use Listeners set ListenPort
# in pol.cfg to 0.
