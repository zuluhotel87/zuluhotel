<I>How to create an enchanted items?</I>
<BR>
<BR>
First you need an alchemical symbol, only made by crafters with a lot of magery. Alchemycal symbol retains the magical effects to eventually apply on the item.
<BR>
<BR>
Secondly you need any kind of excepionnal clothing ( excepionnal robe, excepionnal half apron, excepionnal pants, ... ). No magic or normal items can be used.
<BR>
<BR>
Then use your skill inscription on your exceptionnal clothing item. 
<BR>
<BR>
You will now be prompted to target an alchemical symbol that will determine the magic effect on the item. 
<BR>
<BR>
And finally, gems will be requested. Some gems are found with a jeweler merchant some others are only found on creatures.

Note: The same process apply if you want to recharge your enchanted item again.
