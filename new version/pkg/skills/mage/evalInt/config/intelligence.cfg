# Purpose:
# Defines Portions of the response when using Anatomy skill.
#
# Structure:

# {
#    [Strength	(strength_amount/10)	(Phrase)]
# }
#
# Explanation
# Be sure to use a TAB between strength_amount and phrase. The script uses this in order
# to seperate them when it reads all the elements.
# Phrase defines the UNIQUE name for this strength level. The strength is looked at as
# if the target's strength is below the defined amount but higher than others that are
# defined.
#
# For elements, there is 2 "variables" you can include in the phrases. These will be
# replaced accordingly within the script by their counterparts. <gender> will be replaced
# with the result of sub_reply.gender, <super> will be replaces by sub_reply.super.
