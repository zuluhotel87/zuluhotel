#
# Be sure to set InvulTag to 2 if using AOSTooltip setting. This is so the Invul
# color will show correctly in the tooltips.
#
UOFeatureEnable=0x0

#
# HiddenTurnsCount
# This will define whether or not turns made while hidden will count as a "move".
# It defaults to 1, which is the way POL has always previously operated.  If set
# to zero, then if you are hidden and make a turn, it will not count against your
# stealth steps, nor will it unhide you if you are not stealthing.  If set to one,
# turns while hidden do count against stealthsteps, and will unhide you if you
# are not stealthing.
#
HiddenTurnsCount=0

#
# InvulTag
# This will define whether or not to display the Invul tag for mobs, and if so, HOW
# to display them. It defaults to 1, which is the way POL has always previously operated.
# If set to zero, then there will be no way to tell invuls from not by single click, etc.
# If set to 2 (only use this if your shard is for 3.x+ Clients!) it will remove the
# invul tag on their name, and make them highlightable as Yellow/Gold instead!
#
InvulTag=1

#
# MaxPathFindRange
# This will define the maximum distance between the start and destination points
# which pathfinding will be performed on.  If PathFind is called on points greater
# than this value, an error result will be returned with "Beyond Max Range." as
# the errortext. Default value for this is 50.
#
MaxPathFindRange=50

#
# ScriptedAttackChecks - Determines if the core handles checks to validate a combat attack turn.
#                    0: (Default)
#                    If disabled, core handles the following checks:
#                    Attacker and defender are both alive.
#                    Defender is in range of the attacker's weapon.
#                    Neither the defender nor the attacker is hidden.
#                    The defender's conceal level is equal-to or lesser than the attacker's command level.
#                    The attacker has line of sight to the defender.
#
#                    1:
#                    If enabled the combat hook or hit script must perform the necessary checks.
#
ScriptedAttackChecks=1

#
# ItemColorMask
# It is a bitmask of what colors should be considered valid.  For example, with an
# ItemColorMask of 0xFFF, any color from 0 to 4095 is considered a valid color.With
# an ItemColorMask of 0xFF, this would be reduced to a range from 0 to 255.  It was
# left a mask instead of given as a range in order to allow specifying certain bits
# to be on.  So, for instance, with the newer clients, a mask of 0x4FFF will allow
# the third bit (value 4) of the most significant nibble to be turned on, but no
# others in that nibble.  This allows for newer clients to use the "transparent
# animation" feature, which allows equipped mounts to be transparent(ie, ethereals).
# Bear in mind, older clients may well crash if you set colors to be outside of the
# non-default mask of 0xFFF, so this is strictly at your own risk to use it.  But
# for those of you wishing ethereal beetles and other mount animations to be
# ethereal, you will have to set the mount piece to be color 0x4001 and then equip
# it. And in order to do that, you will need an ItemColorMask of 0x4FFF.

# ItemColorMask=0x4FFF
# Uncomment this if you want ethereal mounts and do not use older clients.

# SpeechRange - default 12

# UseContainerSlots - true/false, default false
UseContainerSlots=0

# MaxContainerSlots - This will allow setting the internal overall allowed item count for containers.
#                     This is introduced for future KR support. KR client is only 125, but we are
#                     making this here so custom clients later can support more slots.
#                     If you have containers with max item count over 125 and use ONLY 2D,
#                     and not KR, set this to your highest amount used!
MaxContainerSlots=1000

# SupportFaces - 0/1/2 (default 0)
#                Set it to 1 to support basic faces
#                Set it to 2 to support roleplay faces (sets 0x2000 flag in 0xB9 packet)
#                Note: Faces are normal items (like hair/beard) with layer 15, objtype 0x3B44-0x3B57
#                roleplay faces 0x3B4E-0x3B57

# CoreSendsSeason - 1/0 (default 1)
