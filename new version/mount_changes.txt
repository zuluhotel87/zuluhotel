		- llama
		- ostard
		- spider

		- unicorn
	- new pkgs include

- All "ethereal" mounts are now hued 0x4001
- Stats and skills modeled after the OSI/ServUO min/max numbers utilizing the POL Dice Generator

- Possible issues may include:
	- incorrect resistances as I have not delved into the resistance cprop stuff
	  found on mobs.
	- Some of the more newer mobs or rarer mobs might have their numbers completely
	  off as there was a bit of guess work and inginuity put into figuring out
	  appropriate numbers.
	- All "ethereal" creatures match their normal counter parts as "ethereals" are
	  summoned via a statuette on OSI/ServUO shards and as such, there were no stats
	  I could easily find.
- In terms of the armored swamp dragon, it's stats match those of it's unarmored counter part
  as on OSI/ServUO, the armored swamp dragon becomes armored by using a Dragon Barding Deed on it.

  Change uoconvert.cfg to old_uoconvert.cfg and rename ToC_uoconvert.cfg to uoconvert.cfg to enable the new mounts.
  You must rebuild your tile.cfg file after renaming ToC_uoconvert.cfg.
