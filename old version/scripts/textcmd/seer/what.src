//This command now prompts you for a location, then an npc type (human, animal, monster), then 
//     for a specific npc in that category (from spawndef.cfg, must add new npcs to both npcdesc
//     AND spawndef.cfg for them to be available). This then appends the spawns.cfg with the needed
//     data.
